Assume that I am a company that will hire the 4 fastest people to solve this task.
Your assignment is to create a Rest API in Node that can send emails using your own email serving as a SMTP server. 

Requirement I want you to use:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer

Hide your passwords for when you show me or others the solution.
password.js: module.myPassword = "password"; 
app.js: var password = require("./password");
        console.log(password.myPassword);

For this assignment you are allowed to authenticate using a plain-text password instead of OAuth2.
If you are using gmail this requires you to temporarily allow less secure apps to send mails on your behalf. 

https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

If you are using a different mail service and the instructions don't work out-of-the-box then google what to do specific to that mail service. 

Remember to disable this after the lesson!
